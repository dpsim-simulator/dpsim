# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- General configuration ------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc'

# The suffix(es) of source filenames.
# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:

# |version| and |release|, also used in various other places throughout the
# built documents.
#
# The short X.Y version.

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.

# a list of builtin themes.
